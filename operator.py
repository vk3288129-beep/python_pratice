# 1. arithmatic operators

# => + (Addition)
# => - (Subtraction)
# => * (Multiplication)
# => / (Division)     
# => % (Modulus)
# => ** (Exponentiation)
# => // (Floor Division)


# x = 10 
# y = 3
# print("The addition of x and y is: ", x + y)    # 13


# x = 10 
# y = 3
# print("The subtraction of x and y is: ", x - y)    # 7


# x = 10 
# y = 3
# print("The multiplication of x and y is: ", x * y)    # 30


# 4. Division operator ("/") :-
# => it gives us Quotient value after pefroming division operation.
# => it always returns float value.


# x = 10 
# y = 3
# print("The division of x and y is: ", x / y)    # 3.33

# 5. Floor Division operator ("//") :-

# => it gives us also Quotient value after performing division operation.
# => but it returns only Integer value .


# x = 10 
# y = 3
# print("The floor division of x and y is: ", x // y)    


# modulus operator ("%") :-

# => it gives us remainder value after performing division operation.
 
# x = 10 
# y = 3
# print("The modulus of x and y is: ", x % y)    

# Exponentiation operator ("**") :-
# => it gives us the power value after performing exponentiation operation.




x = 10 
y = 3
print("The modulus of x and y is: ", x ** 3)
